# VantaDB Backup and Snapshot Policy

## Overview

VantaDB supports different storage backends, each with unique operational trade-offs regarding performance, latency, and data protection. As VantaDB modernizes its storage layer (e.g., migrating to [[fjall|Fjall]]), the operational contract for creating database backups changes.

This document outlines the official policy for safely backing up VantaDB data depending on the active backend.

## Policy by Backend

### 1. [[fjall|Fjall]] Backend (Current Default)

**Live Checkpoints / Snapshots**: ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED**

**Why?**
The [[fjall|Fjall]] engine prioritizes low-latency ingestion and lock-free concurrency. In its current version, it does not expose a native API for creating point-in-time consistent physical snapshots of the SSTables while the database is actively writing.

**How to Backup:**
Operators MUST NOT rely on `create_life_insurance` (native snapshots). Attempting to do so will safely abort with an explicit error.
Instead, use one of the following strategies:

1. **Volume-Level Snapshots (Recommended):** Use your cloud provider's snapshot capability on the underlying disk (e.g., AWS EBS Snapshots, GCP Persistent Disk Snapshots) or OS-level filesystem snapshots (like ZFS/LVM). [[fjall|Fjall]] is crash-safe; a volume snapshot will capture a crash-consistent state that VantaDB can recover from.
2. **Cold Backups:** Safely shut down the VantaDB process and create a standard copy/tarball of the data directory.

Cold-copy restore is now part of the fast validation suite for the default
[[fjall|Fjall]] path. The restore check reopens the copied directory and verifies
canonical memory records, [[bm25|BM25]]/phrase text search, and Hybrid Retrieval v1.

### 2. [[rocksdb|RocksDB]] Backend (Explicit Fallback)

**Live Checkpoints / Snapshots**: ✅ **SUPPORTED**

**Why?**
[[rocksdb|RocksDB]] provides a native `Checkpoint` API that hardlinks SSTables to create a point-in-time snapshot without stopping the database.

**How to Backup:**
Operators can continue using the `create_life_insurance` API. This will instantly create a consistent snapshot directory without downtime.

### 3. InMemory Backend (Testing Only)

**Live Checkpoints / Snapshots**: ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED**

Data is ephemeral and lost upon shutdown. No backup mechanism is provided or needed.

## Manual Compaction Policy

Like backups, **manual compaction** is explicitly governed by the backend capabilities:

- **[[rocksdb|RocksDB]]**: Supports manual compaction. The VantaDB maintenance worker will periodically trigger this to aggressively reclaim disk space from tombstones.
- **[[fjall|Fjall]]**: Does not support manual compaction triggers. [[fjall|Fjall]]'s internal LSM tree aggressively self-manages compaction in the background. The maintenance worker will log an expected degradation (an informational skip) rather than attempting to force a compaction.

## Compatibility and Migration

As of the current version, **[[fjall|Fjall]] is the default backend**.

**New Installations:**
All new instances created via `StorageEngine::open()` or by using `EngineConfig::default()` will automatically initialize with [[fjall|Fjall]].

**Existing Deployments:**
If a directory is already populated with [[rocksdb|RocksDB]] data, attempting to open it with [[fjall|Fjall]] as the default will result in an initialization error. To safely upgrade or maintain an existing database:
- **To keep using [[rocksdb|RocksDB]]:** You MUST explicitly configure `BackendKind::RocksDb` in your `EngineConfig` before opening the engine.
- **To migrate to [[fjall|Fjall]]:** A logical migration (exporting data and re-importing into a new [[fjall|Fjall]]-backed instance) is required.

## JSONL Export Is Not a Physical Backup

`export_namespace`, `export_all`, and `vanta-cli export` serialize canonical
memory records only. They intentionally do not serialize [[hnsw|HNSW]] files, backend
SSTables, [[wal|WAL]] files, derived namespace indexes, or text-index internals.

Use JSONL for logical movement, portability, and rebuildable imports. Use
backend snapshots or cold copies when the requirement is physical backup and
restore of an embedded database directory.

## Operator Restore Check

For [[fjall|Fjall]] cold backups:

1. Stop the process or close the embedded handle.
2. Copy the full database directory to the restore location.
3. Open the restored directory with `VantaEmbedded::open`.
4. Run `vanta-cli audit-index --db <restored> --json --deep`.
5. Run representative memory search checks for vector-only, text-only, and
   hybrid retrieval.

If the audit reports drift, run `vanta-cli rebuild-index --db <restored>` and
repeat the audit before treating the restore as healthy.
