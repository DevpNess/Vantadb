# Experimental Features and Product Boundary

This document classifies the current v0.1.x repository surface. It is the operational reference for
what is production-facing, optional, experimental, or deferred.

## Production-Facing MVP

The v0.1.x product boundary is an embedded local-first persistent memory engine:

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Embedded Rust SDK and CLI | Production-facing |
| Memory `put/get/delete/list/search` | Production-facing |
| WAL-backed recovery | Production-facing |
| Namespaces and scalar metadata filters | Production-facing |
| Derived namespace and metadata indexes | Production-facing |
| HNSW vector retrieval | Production-facing |
| BM25 lexical retrieval | Production-facing |
| Hybrid Retrieval v1 with deterministic RRF | Production-facing |
| Basic phrase filtering | Production-facing |
| Manual rebuild and structural audit flows | Production-facing |
| JSONL export/import | Production-facing |
| Source-installed Python SDK | Production-facing |

## Optional

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local `vanta-server` binary | Optional wrapper around the embedded core | Local dev / network exposure |
| Local ONNX embeddings (`embed-local` feature, `LocalOnnxProvider`) | **Optional local-first** | Offline, `ort`+`tokenizers`, 9 models (8 ≤3 GB + Qwen3 exception), default `multilingual-e5-small` 384d — see `docs/api/EMBEDDINGS.md`, `embeddings/manifest.json`, `docs/tutorials/05-embedding-integrations.md` |

The server and `embed-local` are optional wrappers around the same embedded core. `embed-local` is **not Experimental** — it is a supported offline path (BYO-vector remains default).

## Experimental or Not MVP

These surfaces may exist in the repository, but they are not stable product claims for v0.1.x:

| Area | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| IQL/LISP/DQL parser, evaluator, and executor paths | **Archived (2024-06-10)** - Runtime LISP evaluation abandoned due to borrow checker issues and GIL blocking. See `archive/experimental-quarantine-2024-06/`. Legacy fuzz target for LISP parser preserved in [`FUZZING.md`](FUZZING.md) |
| MCP API | Experimental integration surface |
| Remote LLM/Ollama integration (`remote-inference` feature, `OllamaProvider`/`OpenAIProvider`) | External optional integration, not core dependency — alternative to `embed-local` |
| Governance and maintenance semantics | **Archived (2024-06-10)** - Runtime governance framework incompatible with compile-time governance via IQL AST Pass. Useful utilities extracted to `src/utils/` |
| Graph traversal beyond stored local edges | Experimental, not a graph database claim |
| Docker/Ollama examples | Experimental development examples |

## Extracted Utilities (Production-Ready)

The following utilities were extracted from experimental governance and are now part of the core API:

| Utility | Purpose | API Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DuplicatePreventionFilter | Bloom filter for duplicate prevention in multi-writer scenarios | `vantadb::utils::DuplicatePreventionFilter` |
| OriginCollisionTracker | Collision tracking and friction metrics for multi-agent coordination | `vantadb::utils::OriginCollisionTracker` |
| compute_confidence_friction | Functional friction metric computation for conflict analysis | `vantadb::utils::compute_confidence_friction` |

These utilities are stateless, well-tested, and suitable for production use in multi-writer and multi-agent scenarios.

Visible in-tree examples and docs must carry the same boundary:

- `examples/docker/docker-compose.ollama.yml`
- `examples/docker/Dockerfile`
- `examples/docker/start.sh`
- `examples/python/langchain_rag.py`

## Deferred

The following are explicitly outside the v0.1.x MVP:

| Area | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Agent metacognition and automatic memory consolidation | Deferred |
| Plugins and marketplace | Deferred |
| RBAC, true multi-tenancy, quotas, and enterprise audit | Deferred |
| HA, replication, clustering, and cloud managed service | Deferred |
| Production PyPI publication and signed installers | Deferred |
| Advanced ranking, snippets, highlighting, Unicode folding, stopwords, stemming | Deferred |
| SQL, general OLTP, warehouse, and time-series workloads | Deferred |
