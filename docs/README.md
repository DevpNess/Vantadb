# VantaDB Documentation

Welcome to the VantaDB documentation vault.

This directory (`docs/`) is the root of the project's Obsidian vault. All documentation is centralized here.

## Main Index

The primary entry point to all documentation is the [[master-index|Master Index]], which organizes the content into:

- **MPTS** — Complete technical specification (architecture, SDK, operations, roadmap, glossary)
- **End Users** — Quickstart, migration guides, case studies, technical articles, GraphRAG
- **Developers** — API reference, architecture, ADRs, experiments, implementation plans
- **Operators** — Configuration, CI/CD, benchmarks, monitoring, governance
- **Project Tracking** — Backlog, progress, changelog, devlog

## Conventions

- Documentation is primarily written in English.
- Spanish is permitted in `glosario/` (bilingual glossary terms) and `web/` (market research, Spanish-language user research).
- Internal vault links use Obsidian wikilinks format (`[[Link]]`) for seamless navigation.
- Public-facing documentation retains GitHub-compatible markdown links where required.
