    q: "Is VantaDB really free?",
    a: "Yes. The core engine is Apache 2.0 licensed and free forever. No hidden pricing, no per-query fees, no artificial limits on self-hosted instances.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use VantaDB commercially?",
    a: "Yes. The Apache 2.0 license allows unrestricted use, modification, and distribution. No royalties, no attribution required for local self-hosted deployments.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer custom SLAs?",
    a: "Yes, our Enterprise plan includes custom licensing and priority support windows. We also assist with specialized hardware configuration, on-premises isolation, and security compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA). Enterprise SLA terms are negotiated per-contract.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is VantaDB different from Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant?",
    a: "VantaDB is embedded — it runs in your process with zero servers. No network hop, no per-vector pricing, no ops team required. While cloud vector databases charge $70-175/mo, VantaDB is free (Apache 2.0) and runs locally.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I migrate from Pinecone/ChromaDB to VantaDB?",
    a: "Yes. We provide migration guides from ChromaDB and LanceDB in our documentation. The process typically involves exporting your vectors and re-indexing with VantaDB's Python SDK.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a vector limit in Self-Hosted?",
    a: "Self-Hosted has no artificial caps — your only limit is your hardware. We believe in free, unrestricted access to vector search.",
  },
